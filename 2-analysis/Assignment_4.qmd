## Methods

#### Description of the dataset

We used a simulated a cross-sectional dataset of `r nrow(d)` observations. Our primary outcome is the presence of absence of any cardiac event in the past five years. Our exposure is being a smoker versus not being a smoker during this period. Our dataset included the covariates sex, age and cost of any medical treatment incurred during the study period. The variable sex was coded as a binary variable (reference group is males) while age (years) and cost ($) where continuous. The code and data used to generate this report can be found at <https://github.com/suhihanif/Assignment-4>.

#### Primary analysis

For our first aim, we fit a generalized linear model with a binomial family to evaluate the association between smoking and experiencing a cardiac event, adjusting for sex and age. Below is our regression model for aim 1:

<br>\
$$
\text{logit}(E[Y \mid X]) = \text{logit}(p(\text{cardiac event}))) = \beta_0 + \beta_1\,\text{smoking} + \beta_2\,\text{sex} + \beta_3\,\text{age}$$

<br>

-   The intercept $\beta_0$ represents the log odds of experiencing a cardiac event in male non-smokers with age 0 years

-   The coefficient $\beta_1\,\text{smoking}$ represents the change in the log odds of experiencing a cardiac events for participants who ever smoked during the study period compared to participants who did not, holding age and sex constant

-   The coefficient $\beta_2\,\text{sex}$ represents the change in the log odds of experiencing a cardiac events for female participants compared to male participants, holding smoking status and age constant

-   The coefficient $\beta_3\,\text{age}$ represents the change in the log odds of experiencing a cardiac events for each additional year of age, holding smoking status and sex constant

#### Secondary analysis

For our second aim, we were interested to see if the cost of medical treatments during the study period modified the relationship between smoking and having a cardiac event. Below is our regression model for aim2:

<br>

$$
\text{logit}(E[Y \mid X]) = \text{logit}(p(\text{cardiac event}))) = \beta_0 + \beta_1\,\text{smoking} + \beta_2\,\text{sex} + \beta_3\,\text{age} + \beta_4\,\text{cost} + \beta_5\,\text{smoking}*\text{cost}$$

<br>

-   The intercept $\beta_0$ represents the log odds of experiencing a cardiac event in male non-smokers with age 0 years and cost of medical treatment $0.

-   The coefficient $\beta_1\,\text{smoking}$ represents the change in the log odds of experiencing a cardiac events for participants who ever smoked during the study period compared to participants who did not, holding age, sex and cost constant

-   The coefficient $\beta_2\,\text{sex}$ represents the change in the log odds of experiencing a cardiac events for female participants compared to male participants, holding smoking status, age and cost constant

-   The coefficient $\beta_3\,\text{age}$ represents the change in the log odds of experiencing a cardiac events for each additional year of age, holding smoking status, sex and cost constant

-   The coefficient $\beta_4\,\text{cost}$ represents the change in the log odds of experiencing a cardiac events for each additional dollar spent on medical treatment, holding smoking status, sex and age constant

-   The coefficient $\beta_5\,\text{smoking}*{cost}$ represents the additional change in the log odds of experiencing a cardiac events for each additional dollar spent on treatment for participants who ever smoked compared to participants who did not, holding sex and age constant

Table 1 shows the characteristics of study participants. Out of `r nrow(d)` participants, `r stats[1,5]` experienced a cardiac event. Among participants with no cardiac events, `r stats[1,2]`% were smokers and `r stats[2,2]`% were female. Among participants who experienced cardiac events, `r stats[1,4]`% were smokers and `r stats[2,4]`% were female. Participants who experienced cardiac events were on average older (mean age `r stats[3,4]` years) and had spent more on medical treatment (mean cost $`r stats[4,4]`).

# create bar plot of age by cardiac status 
box <- ggplot(d, aes(x = factor(cardiac, labels = c("No event", "Cardiac event")), y = age)) +
  geom_boxplot() +

  ylab("Age") +
  theme_classic()

# save box plot of age by cardiac event 
ggsave(filename = "box_plot_age_cardiac.jpg", plot = box, path = "3-output")

# check median ages by cardiac group  
cardiac_age <- median(d$age[d$cardiac == 1])
control_age <- median(d$age[d$cardiac == 0])


```

The median age for participants who had a cardiac event was slightly higher (`r cardiac_age` years) than the median age (`r control_age` years) for participants who did not have a cardiac event (Figure 1). The simulated dataset did not contain any outliers for age.

d <- d %>%

                                 cardiac == 1 ~ "Cardiac event"))
                            
# create density plot of cost by cardiac event status 
plot <- ggplot(d, aes(x=cost, fill=cardiac_cat)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(fill="") +

  ylab("Density") +
  theme_classic()

# save density plot 
ggsave(filename = "density_plot_cost_cardiac.jpg", plot = plot, path = "3-output")

# remove categorical variable for cardiac event 
d <- d %>% select(-cardiac_cat)

# range for costs 
min_card <- sprintf("%.0f", min(d$cost[d$cardiac == 1]))
max_card <- sprintf("%.0f", max(d$cost[d$cardiac == 1]))

min_cont <- sprintf("%.0f", min(d$cost[d$cardiac == 0]))
max_cont <- sprintf("%.0f", max(d$cost[d$cardiac == 0]))
```

On average, partcipants who experienced cardiac events had higher treatment costs (range: $`r min_card` to $`r max_card`) compared to participants who did not experience cardiac events (range: $`r min_cont` to $`r max_cont`) with overlap in the distribution of costs between the two groups. Figure 2 shows the distribution of treatment costs by cardiac event status.

Results from the primary analysis are presented in Table 2. Being a smoker was associated with higher odds of experiencing a cardiac event compared to being a non-smoker (OR `r tableit[2, 1]`, 95% CI: `r tableit[2, 2]`–`r tableit[2, 3]`, *p* = `r tableit[2, 4]`). Being female was associated with lower odds of cardiac events compared to being male (OR `r tableit[3, 1]`, 95% CI: `r tableit[3, 2]`–`r tableit[3, 3]`, *p* = `r tableit[3, 4]`). Age was not significantly associated with experiencing a cardiac event (OR: `r tableit[4, 1]`, 95% CI: `r tableit[4, 2]`–`r tableit[4, 3]`, *p* = `r tableit[4, 4]`).


```{r}
#| label: secondary-analysis-regression

# run logistic regression with interaction term for cost and smoking
glm.fit2 <- glm(cardiac ~ female + age + cost + smoke*cost, data = d, family = "binomial")

tableit2 <- data.frame(summary(glm.fit2)$coef)
tableit2$OR <- sprintf("%.2f", exp(tableit2$Estimate))
tableit2$LCL <- sprintf("%.2f", exp(tableit2$Estimate - tableit2$Std..Error * 1.96 ))
tableit2$UCL <- sprintf("%.2f", exp(tableit2$Estimate + tableit2$Std..Error * 1.96 ))
tableit2$`p-value` <- sprintf("%.3f", tableit2$Pr...z..)

tableit2 <- tableit2[, c("OR", "LCL", "UCL", "p-value")]

# add row labels 
labels2 <- c("Intercept", "Smoker", "Is female", "Age (years)", "Cost of treatment ($)", "Smoker × Cost interaction")
row.names(tableit2) <- labels2

# rename columns
colnames(tableit2) <- c("Odds Ratio", "Lower", "Upper", "P value")

# create formatted table with kable for report output 
kable(tableit2, digits = 2, caption = "Table 3: Effect modification by cost of treatment") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F) %>%
  kable_styling()

# save table 3 
write.csv(tableit2, "3-output/reg_out2.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
The interaction between smoking and cost of treatment was not statistically significant (OR `r tableit2[6, 1]`, 95% CI: `r tableit2[6, 2]`–`r tableit2[6, 3]`, *p* = `r tableit2[6, 4]`). Therefore, there is no evidence that the adjusted association between cardiac events and smoking status is modified by the cost of treatment. 

## Discussion
In our primary analysis, we found that cardiac events were significantly associated with smoking. In our secondary analysis, we found no evidence of effect modification of the relationship between smoking and cardiac events by cost of treatment. Our results for our primary analysis are similar to other studies done in the US that found smoking to be associated with an increased risk of cardiac events [@D-Alessandro2012-pa; @Martin2024-sn].
A possible mechanism by which smoking affects cardiac events is that compounds in cigarette smoke lead to oxidative stress, which causes fibrosis in cardiac tissue [@D-Alessandro2012-pa]. Similarly, in another study of cardiac hospitalizations in the US between 2012 and 2018, smoking was significantly associated with joint opioid use and cardiac events [@Martin2024-sn].

A limitation of this study is that the cohort dataset included very few covariates. As a result, the analyses may have been confounded by omitted variable bias. The cohort data is also simulated, and may not have the properties or real-world distributions of covariates that would be found in actual patient data. Future analyses could be carried out with a synthetic dataset that contains information on all potential confounders of the relationship between smoking and cardiac events, such as race, socioeconomic status, exercise levels, and other relevant variables. 

In conclusion, smoking was significantly associated with cardiac events in this analysis but there was no effect modification by cost of treatment using a simulated dataset.
