  abstract  = "Tobacco smoke is the single most important modifiable risk factor
               for coronary diseases and the leading preventable cause of death
               in the US. While the effect of cigarette smoking on the
               progression of atherosclerotic diseases is established and well
               studied, the role of cigarette smoking on cardiac arrhythmia is
               less clearly defined. In fact the pathophysiological mechanism of
               cigarette smoking-induced cardiac arrhythmia is very likely a
               complex one where the pro-fibrotic effect of nicotine on
               myocardial tissue with consequent increased susceptibility to
               catecholamine might play a role. Moreover, other constituents of
               cigarette smoking, such as carbon monoxide and oxidative stress,
               are likely to contribute to the generation of arrhythmias.
               Finally, cigarette smoking may induce coronary artery disease and
               chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which also might cause
               arrhythmia independently. The objective of this paper is to
               summarize the published studies relating to cardiac arrhythmia
               induced by cigarette smoking, and to identify a
               pathophysiological mechanism by which cigarette smoking might
               induce cardiac arrhythmia.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The American Heart Association (AHA), in conjunction
               with the National Institutes of Health, annually reports the most
               up-to-date statistics related to heart disease, stroke, and
               cardiovascular risk factors, including core health behaviors
               (smoking, physical activity, nutrition, sleep, and obesity) and
               health factors (cholesterol, blood pressure, glucose control, and
               metabolic syndrome) that contribute to cardiovascular health. The
               AHA Heart Disease and Stroke Statistical Update presents the
               latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory
               disease conditions (including stroke, brain health, complications
               of pregnancy, kidney disease, congenital heart disease, rhythm
               disorders, sudden cardiac arrest, subclinical atherosclerosis,
               coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, valvular
               disease, venous thromboembolism, and peripheral artery disease)
               and the associated outcomes (including quality of care,
               procedures, and economic costs). METHODS: The AHA, through its
               Epidemiology and Prevention Statistics Committee, continuously
               monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and
               stroke in the United States and globally to provide the most
               current information available in the annual Statistical Update
               with review of published literature through the year before
               writing. The 2024 AHA Statistical Update is the product of a full
               year's worth of effort in 2023 by dedicated volunteer clinicians
               and scientists, committed government professionals, and AHA staff
               members. The AHA strives to further understand and help heal
               health problems inflicted by structural racism, a public health
               crisis that can significantly damage physical and mental health
               and perpetuate disparities in access to health care, education,
               income, housing, and several other factors vital to healthy
               lives. This year's edition includes additional global data, as
               well as data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular
               health in the population, with an enhanced focus on health equity
               across several key domains. RESULTS: Each of the chapters in the
               Statistical Update focuses on a different topic related to heart
               disease and stroke statistics. CONCLUSIONS: The Statistical
               Update represents a critical resource for the lay public,
               policymakers, media professionals, clinicians, health care
               administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking
               the best available data on these factors and conditions.",
